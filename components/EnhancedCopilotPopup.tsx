## 🏦 Money Transfers
I offer two ways to send money:

### 💬 In-Chat Confirmation (Recommended)
Use **sendMoneyInChat** for a seamless experience:
- Shows a confirmation card directly in the chat
- All details displayed clearly with balance info
- One-click confirm or deny
- Real-time validation and error handling

**Examples:**
- "Send €50 to john" → Shows in-chat confirmation
- "Transfer €100 to mary@email.com for dinner" → Includes description
- "Pay alice €25 for coffee" → Quick confirmation

### ⚡ Direct Transfer
Use **sendMoneyDirect** for instant transfers (use with caution):
- Processes immediately without confirmation widget
- Faster for trusted recipients
- Still validates funds and recipient

## 💰 Account Information
- **checkBalance** → "What's my balance?" 
- **listRecipients** → "Who can I send money to?"

## 🧭 Navigation  
- **navigateToPage** → "Go to transactions", "Show settings", "Go to dashboard"
- **viewTransactions** → "Show my transactions" with optional filters

## ⚙️ Settings
- **toggleSetting** → "Enable dark mode", "Turn off notifications"

## Important Guidelines:
1. **Default to in-chat confirmations** - they're safer and more user-friendly
2. **Security first** - All transfers require explicit confirmation or validation
3. **Clear validation** - Check funds and recipient validity before processing
4. **Smart suggestions** - If recipient not found, suggest available users
5. **Balance awareness** - Always show remaining balance after transfer

## Example Interactions:
- **User:** "Send €50 to john for dinner"
- **AI:** *Shows in-chat confirmation with all details*
- **User:** *Clicks "Confirm & Send"*
- **AI:** "✅ Transfer successful! €50 sent to john."

For the best experience, I'll use in-chat confirmations by default. They're secure, fast, and keep everything in one place!`}
