AI-powered banking application

A project developed in the first semester at **FH OberÃ¶sterreich Campus Hagenberg** Department of **Interactive Media**


Quantum Bank allows users to send, receive, and transfer money, check their transactions and visualize the data in various ways.

The project uses [React](https://react.dev/) for the frontend and a lightweight [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) backend showcasing the integration of modern web technologies for a seamless user experience. Styling was done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), as well as additional UI components from [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
